# Borderlands Helper

## Introduction

> Got tired of execing the community patch so that is where this all started. It has evolved over time to include farming reset hotkeys, a colorblind fix key, and a tracker and logger for farming runs.
> Only exec patch and normal reload work for TPS as of now
